# Nuvoton Action Recognition

This project implements an action recognition system using the C programming language, specifically designed for deployment on the Nuvoton Developer Board.

## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to recognize human actions using sensor data and embedded software, optimized for the Nuvoton board environment. The system processes input signals and classifies user actions in real time, making it suitable for embedded applications that require gesture or movement recognition.

## Features

- **Action Recognition:** Detects and classifies various user actions from sensor inputs.
- **Embedded C Implementation:** Written in C for efficiency and portability on embedded systems.
- **Nuvoton Board Deployment:** Tailored for the Nuvoton Developer Board, leveraging its hardware capabilities.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Designed to process data and recognize actions with minimal latency.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - Nuvoton Developer Board (compatible model)
   - Required sensors or peripherals as specified in your hardware setup

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - C compiler/toolchain for Nuvoton boards
   - Nuvoton SDK and drivers (consult the board documentation)

3. **Build & Flash:**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/j1018y/Nuvoton_Action_Recognition.git
     ```
   - Build the project using your preferred toolchain.
   - Flash the compiled binary to your Nuvoton board.

4. **Usage:**
   - Power on the Nuvoton board with the firmware loaded.
   - Interact with the system according to the supported gestures or actions.
   - The system will output recognized actions (consult code for specifics).
